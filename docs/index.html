<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Mobile robots are nowadays frequently used for
  interaction tasks in the real world, e.g. for opening doors or for
  pick-and-place tasks. When used in real-world environments,
  adapting the robot controllers to uncertain contact dynamics
  is a significant challenge. Adaptive Model Predictive Control
  (AMPC) is an approach for controlling robot motions while
  adapting to uncertain or changing dynamics. However, most
  of the existing AMPC approaches used in mobile manipulation
  require either expert tuning or extensive training, making it
  very difficult to introduce novel or diverse tasks. In addition,
  the adjustment of several, independent environment parameters
  is usually not considered in the AMPC formulation. In this
  work, we introduce a hierarchical approach that uses Gaussian
  Mixture Models (GMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Regression
  (GMR) to predict the dynamic model parameters of MPC
  based on proprioceptive measurements and perform tasks with
  multiple unknown environmental parameters. The approach is
  evaluated in simulation and in real experiments on a mobile
  manipulator and compared to several baseline methods. It
  is shown that it outperforms standard MPC and an existing
  AMPC approach on several tasks such as carrying, pushing,
  and door opening.</p>

<h2 id="Methodology">Methodology</h2>
Since many robotic tasks can be
described by a combination of simple carrying, pushing,
and pulling tasks, a Spring-Mass-Damper (SMD) system is used to model the
contact forces exerted by the robot on the environment. The
parameters of the SMD system are adjusted online while
an unknown task is executed. To achieve this, we collect a dataset 
of state errors from known environments with different contact dynamics.
Then, we model the joint probability distribution of the dynamic parameters
and the state error measurements as multivariate Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs), one for each executed task. For
prediction, we use a hierarchical approach. First, the most
likely GMMs for the current task are selected by comparing
their log-likelihoods using state error measurements as input.
Then, the computed probabilities are used to predict the
environmental damping and stiffness by weighted averages.
Second, the most likely model is used to predict the remaining
dynamic model parameters online, i.e., spring mass, inertia, and
static force.

<h2 id="results">Experimental Evaluation</h2>
In the following video, the results from three experiments are
presented. First, the generality of the proposed
method is compared to baseline methods by evaluating
the performance on executing unseen, unrelated tasks with
increasing complexity (see Fig. 1.a). Second, we focus on
similar tasks where the environment parameters are very
difficult to distinguish because of overlapping effects, such as
pushing objects over different floors and opening doors with
friction. Thirdly, our method is applied on the real system
to show its feasibility for carrying and pulling tasks.
